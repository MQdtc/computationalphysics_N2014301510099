# Abstract
*In this Report, I will show some codes which are used to slove some realistic projection motions. Along with the book and professor Cai's [teaching plan](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s140/sh/26f85380-ee6c-4b4b-b33f-6871804d91ff/fb8cc702cb0e8ed7fafb50b2de4596ca), I will show you:*
> * Linear motion with air resistance---problem 2.5;
> * Two-dimensional projectile motion with air resistance---Problem 2.9;
> * Projectile motion with air drag, wind, or spin---Problem2.27.
