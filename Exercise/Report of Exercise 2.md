# Abstract
-------
*Actually, This is my first homework of computational physics. In this exercise we are excepted to spell out our English name on the screen with the letters, and we should finish this using the function print of Python.*(To be  continued)

# Background
--------
As is known to all, output is an important component of a program. Through the output we can directly known the result of a program or a part of codes after excuteing, And additionally, sometimes using graphic output is better, just like this exercise, the effects are totally different between  print your name using letters and using pixel lattice.(To be continued)
